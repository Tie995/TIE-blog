About Me
SUFE
I am Yixuan Qiu, currently an associate professor in School of Statistics and Management at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). Before joining SUFE in 2020, I was as a postdoctoral researcher in Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Dr. Kathryn Roeder and Dr. Jing Lei. I obtained my PhD degree in statistics from Purdue University in 2018, advised by Dr. Lingsong Zhang and Dr. Xiao Wang. Prior to my PhD study in Purdue, I graduated from Renmin University of China for B.A. and M.A. in statistics and actuarial science, respectively.

My research focuses on statistical machine learning and inference. I have great interest in statistical computing, deep learning, exact inference methods, large-scale data analysis, and data visualization. You can find some of my works in the Research page.

I am also enthusiastic about programming and developing high-performance software packages for statistics and machine learning. The Software page lists some open source software packages that I have written and maintained over the years. Feel free to stop by my GitHub page, and even better, give me a star for projects that interest you.

I have been constantly (although slowly!) writing technical blog posts on statistics and programming. Just leave a comment there if you have any thoughts on some topics.

You can always reach me through email, yixuanq [at] gmail [dot] com.
